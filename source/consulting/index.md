I've been working professionally as a software developer for 6 years and have been programming for 12. I've worked on small and enterprise systems spanning across a variety of platforms all written in different programming languages. My goal is to empower business owners to use technology to increase the efficiency of their teams.

Here are the types of projects I work on:

- Web development: I can make you just about anything you want
- Debugging: Are you maintaining a legacy system with bugs that seem impossible to squash? I specialize in identifying and resolving these issues and educating teams how to prevent them in the future.
- Web crawling: If you want to create a distributed system to scrape 10 billion pages, I can make that happen.
- Node.js: I'm intimately familiar with the ins and outs of this platform
