# How to configure your Heroku app to answer ACME challenges using certbot-heroku

Look into one of the subfolders for examples on how you can configure your Heroku app to answer the ACME challenges required to generate (initially, and for renewals) SSL certificates using Let's Encrypt.

Are you using another buildpack on Heroku, and created your own version of this? If so, please send me a Pull Request to document how you did it! Thanks.
